# Naive-Bayes-Classifier

Naive Bayes classifiers are renowned for their simplicity and effectiveness in various machine
learning tasks, including classification and regression. Their innate ability to handle large datasets efficiently, coupled with interpretability, has made them popular in diverse domains. In this study, we delve into the realm of multi-class classification using the estimation of obesity based on eating habits and physical condition dataset., aiming to discern whether the given attributes can accurately predict the multiple obesity status. The study will initially incorporate the Gaussian NB classifier only, to be followed by a combination of Gaussian and the standard Naive Bayes approaches for continuous and categorical attributes respectively
